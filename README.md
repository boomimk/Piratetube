# PirateTube

PirateTube is a small Python script that lets you download YouTube videos straight to your computer.

No websites.
No weird converters.
Just run it and grab what you need.

## What it does

* Downloads YouTube videos
* Lets you pick the quality
* Saves them to your Desktop

## Setup (one-time)

Make sure you have **Python** and **FFmpeg** installed.

Install the only thing it needs:

```bash
pip install yt-dlp
```

Create a folder named:

on your **Desktop**.

> The script downloads videos into this folder.
> You can change this inside the script if you want them saved somewhere else.

Then:
